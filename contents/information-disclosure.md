As preparation for the eWPTX im going to work through the Portswigger labs. In this post im going to steal... take notes about Information Disclosure and resolve the labs. Let's get started!!!

## Whats is Information Disclosure?

Information disclosure, also known as information leakage, occurs when a website unintentionally reveals sensitive information to its users. This can expose data to potential attackers, including:
- Data about other users, such as usernames or financial information
- Sensitive commercial or business data
- Technical details about the website and its infrastructure

## Basic examples of information disclosure


- Hidden Directories: Revealing names, structure, and contents of hidden directories via `robots.txt` files or directory listings.
- Source Code Exposure: Providing access to source code files through temporary backups.
- Error Messages: Explicitly mentioning database table or column names in error messages.
- Sensitive Information: Unnecessarily exposing highly sensitive information, such as credit card details.
- Hard-Coding Secrets: Hard-coding API keys, IP addresses, and database credentials in the source code.
- Application Behavior: Hinting at the existence or absence of resources or usernames through subtle differences in application behavior.

## How to find and exploit information disclosure vulnerabilities ?

- Fuzzing: Sending random or unexpected inputs to the application to uncover how it handles different types of data.
- Using Burp Scanner: Automated tool to scan for vulnerabilities, including information disclosure.
- Using Burp's Engagement Tools: Tools within Burp Suite that help identify and exploit information disclosure vulnerabilities.
- Engineering Informative Responses: Crafting inputs that provoke error messages or other responses revealing useful information.

## Error messages

The content of error messages can be particularly revealing. They can indicate what type of input or data is expected, helping you identify exploitable parameters.

## Lab 1 - Information Disclosure in error messages

>This lab's verbose error messages reveal that it is using a vulnerable version of a third-party framework. To solve the lab, obtain and submit the version number of this framework. 

When start the lab, we see a typically web shop page. Go to View Details.

Prove if we do a error if change the product id.

And yes!

## Debugging Data

Websites often generate custom error messages and logs for debugging purposes. These can unintentionally reveal a lot of information about the application's behavior, such as:

- Session Variables: Values that can be manipulated via user input.
- Back-End Credentials: Hostnames and credentials for back-end components.
- File and Directory Names: Specific file and directory names on the server.
- Encryption Keys: Keys used to encrypt data transmitted via the client.

## Lab 2 - Information Disclosure on debug page

> This lab contains a debug page that discloses sensitive information about the application. To solve the lab, obtain and submit the SECRET_KEY environment variable.

Every time when we do a penetration test in a web application is indispensable read the code of the application for comments.

## User account pages

User account or profile pages typically contain sensitive information. Some websites have logic flaws that allow attackers to exploit these pages to view data belonging to other users. Ensuring proper access controls and validation is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to personal information.
For example:

```GET /user/personal-info?user=carlos```

## Source Code Disclosure via Backup¬†Files

When source code is accessible through backup files, it makes it easier for attackers to understand the application's behavior and launch severe attacks. Sometimes, sensitive data like API keys and credentials are hard-coded within the source code, increasing the risk. To prevent this, ensure that backup files are not publicly accessible.

## Lab 3 - Source code disclosure via backup files

>This lab leaks its source code via backup files in a hidden directory. To solve the lab, identify and submit the database password, which is hard-coded in the leaked source code.

## Information disclosure due to insecure configuration

Websites can be vulnerable if they are improperly configured. This often happens with third-party technologies, where the wide range of configuration options may not be fully understood by those setting them up. Ensuring proper configuration is essential to prevent unintended information disclosure and protect sensitive data.

## Lab 4 - Authentication bypass via information disclosure

> This lab's administration interface has an authentication bypass vulnerability, but it is impractical to exploit without knowledge of a custom HTTP header used by the front-end.To solve the lab, obtain the header name then use it to bypass the lab's authentication. Access the admin interface and delete the user carlos.You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Enter with the credentials 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasGula/NicolasGula/master/public/images/photos/id/l4/1.png)

Before send the request,change the method for Trace.
>The HTTP TRACE method is designed for diagnostic purposes. If enabled, the web server will respond to requests that use the TRACE method by echoing in the response the exact request that was received. This behavior is often harmless, but occasionally leads to information disclosure, such as the name of internal authentication headers that may be appended to requests by reverse proxies. 

And we see when the Request reaches the server,does with a header with our ip address.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasGula/NicolasGula/master/public/images/photos/id/l4/2.png)

Change the url to see if got access to the admin dashboard. But a message appears. "...local users..." ü§î 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasGula/NicolasGula/master/public/images/photos/id/l4/3.png)

Put the header and a local ip. And we see the admin dashboard. Delete a Carlitos.

## Lab 5 - Information disclosure in version control history

>This lab discloses sensitive information via its version control history. To solve the lab, obtain the password for the administrator user then log in and delete the user carlos.

In the end of the URL put ```/.git```.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasGula/NicolasGula/master/public/images/photos/id/l5/1.png)

In ```COMMIT_EDITMSG``` we see this message.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasGula/NicolasGula/master/public/images/photos/id/l5/2.png)

I open my Kali and download.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasGula/NicolasGula/master/public/images/photos/id/l5/4.png)

With the command ```git diff``` i see the difference between two commits.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasGula/NicolasGula/master/public/images/photos/id/l5/5.png)

If i see the history of commits and the comments, i find which commit have the credentials that search.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasGula/NicolasGula/master/public/images/photos/id/l5/6.png)


With ```git checkout``` i change to the branch that have the credentials hardcoded.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasGula/NicolasGula/master/public/images/photos/id/l5/8.png)

To finally, delete Carlos.

I hope you find it useful.üë®‚Äçüíª
If you have another type of solution or if i am mistaken about something, please let me know.
