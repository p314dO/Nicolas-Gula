Hello community! ðŸ‘‹ Today, i'm excited to share my experience diving into web application security through the eWPTv2 (Web Application Penetration Tester) certification. Let's dive into the journey and explore valuable resources to pass this exam easily and without worries.

## Â¿Whats is eWPTv2?

According to [**INE**](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ewpt-certification/), the same as eJPT entry level hacking certification ,"eWPTv2 is a hands-on, professional-level Red Team certification that simulates skills utilized during real-world engagements." 
The exam lasts 10 hours, featuring 50 questions. You don't have to submit a report; just answer the questions. This certifiaction is at the intermediate level of the [**Security Certification Roadmap**](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/)

![Certs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasGula/NicolasGula/master/public/images/photos/seccerts.png)

## Topics
The topics covered include:
* An introduction to Web Application Security testing, covering everything from the HTTP protocol to [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/Top10/) Ten and its [Open Web Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg/tree/master/checklists).
* Web Enumeration and Information gathering.
* [Burpsuite](https://portswigger.net/burp) and [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/).
* XSS
* SQLinjection
* Broken Authentication
* Session Security
* Cross-Site Request Forgery
* Command Injection
* Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerabilities
* Path Traversal
* LFI / RFI
* Web Services
* Security Testing CMS

## Resources
My personal opinion: the course prepares you very well both to take the certification and for the day to day work as a pentester, but obviously, you will encounter things that are not taught in the course and you will have to solve them on your own, as in the job.
That's why, besides leaving you resources where you will learn vulnerabilities and how to exploit them, I will also leave you labs where you will have to think outside the box to solve them.
